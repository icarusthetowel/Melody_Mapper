# Melody Mapper

This is a Next.js application for managing music students, their progress, and schedules. It uses Firebase for authentication and data storage.

## Firebase Setup

To run this application, you need to connect it to a Firebase project. If you don't have one, you can create one for free.

### Step 1: Create a Firebase Project

1.  Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).
2.  Click **Add project** and follow the on-screen instructions to create a new project.

### Step 2: Get Your Firebase Config

1.  In your new Firebase project, click the **</>** icon to add a web app.
2.  Give your app a nickname and click **Register app**.
3.  Firebase will provide you with a `firebaseConfig` object. It will look like this:
    ```javascript
    const firebaseConfig = {
      apiKey: "jqxw...",
      authDomain: "your-project-id.firebaseapp.com",
      projectId: "your-project-id",
      storageBucket: "your-project-id.appspot.com",
      messagingSenderId: "1234567890",
      appId: "1:1234..."
    };
    ```

### Step 3: Add Config to Your Project

1.  In the root directory of this project, you'll find a file named `.env.local`.
2.  Copy the values from your `firebaseConfig` object into this file. The file is already set up with the correct variable names.

    ```env
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key
    NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_auth_domain
    # ...and so on for all the keys.
    ```

### Step 4: Enable Authentication

1.  In the Firebase Console, go to the **Authentication** section.
2.  Click the **Sign-in method** tab.
3.  Click on **Email/Password** and enable it.

### Step 5: Set up Firestore Database

1.  In the Firebase Console, go to the **Firestore Database** section.
2.  Click **Create database**.
3.  Choose to start in **Production mode**.
4.  Select a location for your database.
5.  Go to the **Rules** tab in Firestore.
6.  Copy the contents of the `firestore.rules` file from this project and paste them into the rules editor in the console.
7.  Click **Publish**.
